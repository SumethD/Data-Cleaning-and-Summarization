    "So far, we have been using only a few columns of data from our dataframes to solve simple dataframe manipulation challenges. Our final challenge will be to print out\n",
    "all of the posts as you might see them displayed on the Stack Overflow Website. The format you must use is simple. Here is a template:\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Question <number><tab><username><tab><score> ###\n",
    "Title:<title>\n",
    "<body>\n",
    "### COMMENTS ###\n",
    "### Comment <number><tab><username><tab><score> ###\n",
    "<text>\n",
    "### ANSWERS ###\n",
    "### Answer <number><tab><username><tab><score> ###\n",
    "Title:<title>\n",
    "<body>\n",
    "### COMMENTS ###\n",
    "### Comment <number><tab><username><tab><score> ###\n",
    "<text>\n",
    "```\n",
    "Notes: the <number> field is one that you manually index. So the first question would be 1 and the tenth question would be 10. All questions, comments, and answers should be displayed in decending score order. This should be easy if you got the three files sorted correctly in Exercise 2. Finally, the username must be retrieved from the 'Users.feather' file using the correct key. It should be easy to figure out the key based on the input file if you inspect the column headers. I have provided you with a convenience function that will do the lookup and return a string name once you have the 'Users.feather' file loaded. The <tab> is simply a single tab ('\\t') to separate the three fields."
