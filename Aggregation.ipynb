    "Now that we have several of our dataframes properly sorted, our next goal is to generate some useful information based on the scores. Specifically, we want to Load our Comments-Sorted.feather and Questions-Sorted.feather files, and aggregate the scores based on the 'PostId' and 'ParentId' columns respectively. The key idea is to determine the total score for Answers and Comments for a particular Question (Parent). We will then save these new dataframes for the next exercise and write out the top 10 results for the two new dataframes to prove that we got the right answer. Hint, we will need to resort the two dataframes again after the aggregation using the sort function from the previous exercise using the new aggregate column we create."
